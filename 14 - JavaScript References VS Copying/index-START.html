    // You might think we can just do something like this:
		console.log('Players:', players, 'Team:', team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
		team[3] = 'Lux';

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
		console.log('Players:', players, 'Team:', team);

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
		
    // one way
		const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
		const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
		const team4 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
		team4[3] = 'Tim';
		console.log('Tean4:', team4, 'Players:', players);

		// Another option
		const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
		const captain = person;
		captain.number = 90;
		console.log('Person:', person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
		const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 60 });

		console.log('Person:', person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
		const captain3 = { ...person, location: 'Canada' };
		console.log('Captain3:', captain3);
		console.log('Person:', person);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
